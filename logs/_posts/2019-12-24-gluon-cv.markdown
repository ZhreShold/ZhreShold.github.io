GluonCV provides implementations of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models in computer vision.

It is designed for engineers, researchers, and students to fast prototype products and research ideas based on these models. This toolkit offers four main features:

- Training scripts to reproduce SOTA results reported in research papers
- A large number of pre-trained models
- Carefully designed APIs that greatly reduce the implementation complexity
- Community supports
