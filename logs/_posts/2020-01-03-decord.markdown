`Decord` is a reverse procedure of `Record`. It provides convenient video slicing methods based on a thin wrapper on top of hardware accelerated video decoders, e.g.

- FFMPEG/LibAV
- Nvidia Codecs
- Intel Codecs

`Decord` was designed to handle awkward video shuffling experience in order to provide smooth experiences similar to random image loader for deep learning.

No more fights with seeking in large video, simple use `decord.VideoReader` to access any frame just like a `list`
