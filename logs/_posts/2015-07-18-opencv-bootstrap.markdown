This is a CMake powered bootstrap project for everyone who need to set up OpenCV C++ environment.

With OpenCV-Bootstrap, one can create a valid project in just a few seconds if prerequisites are already satisfied.

## Why
*Keyword: automation.*

Config OpenCV correctly is a trivial but complicated work, even an expert on this area may take a while and googling around to be able to set up all the include directories and link targets.

It is even more frustrating in Visual Studio, where you have to figure out the different link targets according to OpenCV version and debug/release mode.

Hopefully this script will save the waste-of-time useless steps in order to bootstrap a OpenCV project.
