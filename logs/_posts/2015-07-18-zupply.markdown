Zupply is a light-weight, cross-platform, easy to use C++11 library packed with fundamental functions/classes best for reaserches/small projects/demos.

## Github repository

[Zupply](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply)


## Why Zupply
- Tired of repetitive coding on reading/writing files? Logging messages? Loading configurations?
- Feel desperate transferring code to another platform because you hard-coded in platform specific ways?
- Reluctant to use Boost because it's too heavy-weight?
- Hate setting up environments on a clean computer without any develop library which is required to be linked by many programs?
- Just want to build a small demo, why bother libraries such as OpenCV just for reading/writing images?

- ##### If you agree at least two of them, zupply will be the right tool.

## Features
- Zero dependency, only C++ 11 standard
- Designed to be easily included in projects, no need to link
- Pure and clean, everything encapsulated in namespace zz, almost no pollution if you don't expose the namespace ([explain](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Why-not-single-file-and-header-only%3F))
- Targeting Linux/Windows/Mac OS X/Partial Unix based OSes, meanwhile providing unified experience coding on each platform

## What's included
- CLI [Argument-parser](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Argument-Parser)
- INI/CFG [Configuration-file-parser](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Configuration-file-parser)
- Easy to use [Timer and DateTime](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Date-and-Timer) classes to measure time and datetime
- Fast sync/async [Logger](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Logger) with rich information and highly configurable
- Cross-platform functions to handle [filesystems](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Filesystem). (create directory, check file existence, iterate through folder etc...)
- Various [formatting](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Format) functions to (trim/split/replace/...) strings
- Thread safe data structures for specific purposes
- [ProgBar](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Progress-Bar) class that is designed for displaying progress bar inside consoles
- [Image and ImageHdr](https://github.com/ZhreShold/zupply/wiki/Handle-image) class to do basic operations with image, for example, read(JPG, PNG, BMP, TGA, PSD, GIF, HDR, PIC)/write(JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP), crop, resize, pixel-wise access.
- A lot more

## What's under construction
- Serializer/Deserializer: for dump/read objects to/from string directly, binary should also be supported
