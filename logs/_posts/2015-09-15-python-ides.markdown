Though you can always write python scripts using plain text editor, it would never be a pleasant journey except for tiny projects.

There are so many choices suitable for different situations.

## Notepad++ or similar editor

Some text editors which have built-in syntax highlighter and auto-completion are enough for modification and light coding.

Not powerful enough, but at least good start.


## Sublime Text 2/3

Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. It is somehow designed to be more than a text editor, but a light-weight IDE instead.

## Vim/Emacs

Developers who are familiar with them could probably be able to config them to be awesome productive tools. 

Don't wanna get involved in the battle, but for those who didn't even know them, just step away. 

## Atom by Github

Atom is a open-source cross-platform hackable editor with built-in package manager.

## PyCharm
PyCharm is one of the most powerful python IDEs. It comes with fundamental functions, as well as a tool chain for web app development.

Open-source/Classroom/Student licenses are free. (requires approval)

## Spyder + IPython

A free MATLAB substitution for researchers. You got a workspace to check variables just like that in MATLAB!

(Don't forget numpy, scipy and matplotlib to power them up.)
